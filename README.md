# Pythia-Federated-Learning

This code examines the role of the Pythia federated network oracle. At that time, the interaction between applications and network is very limited. This problem might be resolved with the Pythia oracle. Users can ask Pythia, a distributed oracle, queries about network issues including packet delays and bandwidth. Pythia aims to achieve queries regarding future performance. To accomplish this goal, Pythia should absorb passive monitored data that is shared in a private manner. Federated learning is employed to analyse and learn from this passive data and forecast crucial network information. Finding a mechanism to link the Pythia with other internet nodes is the final step in achieving the desired outcome. Socket programming was applied to achieve this.
